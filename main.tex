In this step i attempted to use the range of audio transcribers. While in future i will test Alveo's service. For the sake of this elaboration i manually transcribed using oTranscriber. Manually transcribing wasn't as laborious as I had anticipated and depending on the success I have with Alveo, it's good to know that oTranscriber will be a viable backup plan.
