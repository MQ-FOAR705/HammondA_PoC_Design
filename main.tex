This document's purpose is to outline the software project that I have been working on for Digital Humanities. It is a solution that converts a range of file types to text files for analysis within the VoyantServer software. By placing the files in their necessary locations, this solution will convert and arrange all files within a directory ready for analysis and perform an export of the FIELDNOTES notebook in Joplin. Afterwards the user can simply open Voyant Server and select the converted and exported files for analysis.

\section{Prerequisites}
Please ensure that you are running Windows 10 and have the following software installed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ubuntu Distribution (available in the Windows Store)
    \item Java Version 8.0+
    \item Have 7zip installed (optional)
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation}
\subsection{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In your C: create the folder FOAR705
    \item Download \href{http://docs.voyant-tools.org/resources/run-your-own/voyant-server/#download}{Voyant Server}
    \item Extract the zip file to C:/FOAR705
    \item Open the Ubuntu application
    \item Create a username and password
    \item Install the git package with the command sudo apt-get install git
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Install Joplin}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install as per the instructions here https://joplinapp.org/
    \item Once installed, run joplin and login to your account
    \item Enter : to run commands
    \item Create a Notebook called FIELDNOTES
    \item Run the sync command by typing :sync
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Install Deepspeech}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run command pip3 install deepspeech
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Copy Repository Option: 1}
In Windows, Download and extract this file to the C:/FOAR705 folder

\url{https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/UPb7f1kUdGZMa7w}


\subsection{Copy Repository Option: 2}
If you prefer to copy the repository directly from Github - follow these instructions instead. This will copy the project repository, placing the relevant folder structure, scripts and necessary files onto your computer.
\vspace{0.5cm}
The folder structure should be as follows:\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\includegraphics{folderstructure.JPG}

Navigate the Ubuntu terminal to your base C drive (cd /mnt/c/) and run the following commands:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item git clone https://github.com/MQ-FOAR705/HammondA\_PoC\_Design
    \item cd HammondA\_PoC\_Design
    \item mv project /mnt/c/foar705
    \item cd ..
    \item rm -r HammondA\_PoC\_Design
    \item cd /mnt/c/foar705/project/ubuntu/deepspeech
    \item curl -LO https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.5.1/deepspeech-0.5.1-models.tar.gz
    \item tar xvf deepspeech-0.5.1-models.tar.gz
    \item rm deepspeech-0.5.1-models.tar.gz
    \item mv deepspeech-0.5.1-models models
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Placing the relevant files}
Within the project directory there is a set folder structure, interviews (for wav audio files), fieldnotes (for notes stored in Joplin) and articles (for PDF files). Currently there are test files already placed within these directories, if you would like to add your own please do so in the correct directory according to the file type.

\subsection{Scripts}
Open up the Ubuntu terminal, change directory to /mnt/c/foar705/ubuntu folder and bash the convertall script.

\subsection{Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the Voyant Tools by running the VoyantServer.jar file within the previously extracted folder.
    \item Click Start Server
    \item Wait for web page to load
    \item Click the Upload button and navigate to the C:/FOAR705/Project/ready folder
    \item Select all files and click upload.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Stories and Acceptance Criteria}
\subsection{User Stories}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to convert PDF files into a simple text format.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to convert recorded conversations into a text format.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want to export my field notes for analysis.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to analyse various sources of data together.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want to organise my different sources so their origin can be easily identified.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to submit all my sources for analysis with a single step or upload.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Categorise user stories into themes and identify prerequisites}
The whole solution works according to three main steps. Conversion, Organisation and Analysis. This process depends on the file sources as already having been collected and available locally on my computer. Additionally the following steps must be performed in order from top to bottom. Items written in bold are steps that must be fulfilled to meet the requirements, items in italics are optional.
\subsection{Conversion}
This initial stage is concerned with converting the various types of sources into a single, workable format.

\subsubsection{Interviews}

As a researcher i should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Store .wav files locally
    \item Transcribe them using Mozilla Deepspeech
    \item\textbf{Transcriptions are saved as simple-text files ready for analysis}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Literature}
As a researcher i should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select PDF documents for analysis
    \item Place them into a folder
    \item\textbf{Convert files into a simple-text files}
    \item\textbf{Files saved into a directory ready for analysis}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Fieldnotes}
As a researcher i should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run a command that syncs my Fieldnotes
    \item Export a preselected Notebook for analysis
    \item\textbf{Save filed notes into a folder for analysis}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analysis}
As a researcher i should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open my preferred software for analysis
    \item\textbf{Import all converted sources for comparison analysis}
    \item\textit{View the results of the analysis and trace their origin}
    \item\textbf{Identify new links between sources}
    \item\textit{Export the results as a report for record keeping}
