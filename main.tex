\section{Aim}
This document's purpose is to deconstruct the design and process of my proposed solution. This analysis will help to unpack the steps and experiences involved in the solution thus far.

\section{Stories and Acceptance Criteria}
\subsection{User Stories}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to compare and analyse all my different data types together.

    \item As a researcher, I want to be able to convert my sources, text and data into a single workable format.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want to organise my different sources so their origin can be easily identified.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to submit all my sources for analysis with a single step or upload.
    
    \item As a researcher, with concerns for privacy I do not want my information or research to be available to anyone else.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want to be able to submit multiple files for conversion or upload in order to mitigate repeating tasks.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to analyse the lexicon of my source.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want to be able to identify and trace the analyis' results.
    
    \item As a researcher, I want the ability to produce a report of the analysis that contains the necessary information.
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Categorise user stories into themes and identify prerequisites}
In this step we will identify common themes throughout the user stories
\section{Load these user stories into your project management system}
In this step we will add these stories to our project management software
\section{Export a report from your project management system so that your peers can see how you organised your tasks on Cloudstor.}
We will now export a report
\section{Create a plan for your quality assurance}
Create a testing plan to ensure quality
\section{Make sure that once youâ€™ve planned out all of your user stories, they can accomplish the goal you set for yourself in scoping}
Is the projects goal achievable?
