# Background
This project and collection of software and scripts was designed as part of the Digital Humanities software deployment. It is a text analytical tool that converts various types of files into a single workable format and then submits them together for analysis.

# Outline
This software solution will need to be run on a Windows computer with the Ubuntu distribution available through the Windows store. This solution will utilise three different tools seamlessly. Please ensure you have an account setup in Joplin before continuing.

- Mozilla Deepspeech - https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech
- Xpdftotext - https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html
- Joplin - https://joplinapp.org/

This demonstration of this solution will utilise two files of academic literature in a PDF format. Three very short audio files for transcription and two files of fieldnotes stored within Joplin.

By placing the files in their necessary locations, this solution will convert and arrange all files within a directory ready for analysis. Afterwich the user can simply open Voyant Server and select the directory for analysis.

# Setup
- Download and extract the Voyant Server from
http://docs.voyant-tools.org/resources/run-your-own/voyant-server/#download
